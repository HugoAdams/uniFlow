## Project Description
The Dialogflow V2 Unity Plugin is a continuation from [Api.ai: Unity Plugin](https://github.com/dialogflow/dialogflow-unity-client), which made it easy to integrate the Dialogflow(Api.ai) natural language processing API into your Unity project.

- [Lin Zhang](https://github.com/linzhangcs)

## Define the problem
- Api.ai: Unity Plugin is no longer working in Dialogflow V2, due to the difference in the way the basic system works ([Dialogflow API v2 versus v1](https://miningbusinessdata.com/dialogflow-api-v2-versus-v1/)).
- Dialogflow API V1 will be shut down in one year â€“ on [October 23rd, 2019](https://plus.google.com/+dialogflow/posts/M6EUgZFhckL).
- Our challenge will be figuring out ways to build similar plugin as the Api.ai Unity Plugin that works in Dialogflow V2 system.

## Address Greater Landscape
Opening new possibilities to involve voice-based conversational interaction in VR and AR environment.
